Religion classes are offered through local institute programs or through BYU-Idaho online, depending on a student’s age.</p>

				<h4 id="can_students_age_31_take_institute_courses" class="accordion-heading">Can students age 31+ take institute courses?</h4>

					<p>Students cannot substitute an academic course taken at another school for a Pathway academic course. However, students who can show proof of having previously completed the religion courses FDREL 121, 122, and/or 200 for credit from BYU-Idaho are not required to retake the course(s) and can contact <a target="_blank" href="https://pathway.lds.org/main/advisingandsupport">Pathway Support</a> to request an exception.</p>

			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 id="is_tutoring_available" class="accordion-heading">Is tutoring available?</h4>
				<div id="tutoring" class="answer accordion">

				<div id="requiredcoursealredycredited" class="answer accordion">
					<p>All 18–30-year-old Pathway students are required to take one institute course per semester. If the course being taught in a given semester is one a student has already taken for credit, the student can consider taking a different institute class if one is available.

					<p>Withdrawing from Pathway removes students from all current courses and prevents students from registering for future Pathway courses. Students who withdraw and desire to join the program later will need to reapply.</p>
					<p>To withdraw from Pathway, do the following:
						<ol>
							<li>Log in to <a target="_blank" href="https://pathway.lds.org">pathway.lds.org</a>.</li>

					<p>While the vast majority of Pathway students are pleased with their online instructors, students may occasionally have a complaint or issue with an instructor that needs attention. Following are the steps a student can take to resolve issues with an instructor:
					<ol>
						<li>Contact Instructor: Students should kindly contact their online instructor through email and express their concern(s).</li>
						<li>File a Complaint: If students are not able to resolve their issues through direct contact with their instructors, students have two options: 
						<ul>
							<li>File an anonymous complaint: Students might do this when they want to inform Pathway administration regarding a minor situation. (Example: instructor not responding to email)</li>
							<li>File a formal grievance: Students might file a formal grievance when they are experiencing a major issue with an instructor or when filing an anonymous complaint has not solved the problem. These complaints are not anonymous. (Examples: instructor harassing a student, instructor accusing a student of cheating without evidence)</li>
						</ul>
						Complaints may be filed by contacting <a target="_blank" href="https://pathway.lds.org/main/advisingandsupport">Pathway Support</a>.</li>

				<h4 id="am_i_required_to_go_to_the_Pathway_gatherings" class="accordion-heading">Am I required to go to the Pathway gatherings?</h4>
				<div id="gatheringsrequired" class="answer accordion">
					<p>Yes, attendance at weekly Pathway gatherings is expected and comprises a significant part of a student’s overall course grade. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 id="can_i_miss_a_gathering" class="accordion-heading">Can I miss a gathering?</h4>
				<div id="missagathering" class="answer accordion">
					<p>Yes, but students lose attendance points in their course for every missed gathering. Because attendance comprises a significant part of a student’s overall course grade, students should commit to attending all gatherings.</p>
					<p>In certain situations, including medical emergencies, individual gatherings may be excused for a student. Such determinations, however, are made at the sole discretion of individual online instructors.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 id="what_do_i_do_if_my_gathering_is_cancelled" class="accordion-heading">What do I do if my gathering is cancelled?</h4>
				<div id="gatheringcancelled" class="answer accordion">
					<p>In very rare instances, Pathway missionaries may cancel a gathering due to extreme weather or other unsafe situations. If such a situation occurs, students will not lose attendance points in their course. Students must notify their instructor(s) of the reason for the gathering cancellation and request an attendance exception.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="pf-section show">
				<h4 id="if_i_am_traveling_can_i_attend_a_Pathway_gathering_in_the_area_i_am_visiting_and_receive_attendance_credit" class="accordion-heading">If I am traveling, can I attend a Pathway gathering in the area I am visiting and receive attendance credit?</h4>
				<div id="travel" class="answer accordion">
					<p>Yes, students who are traveling and are unable to attend their assigned academic gathering may attend another gathering in the city they are visiting and still obtain attendance credit. Traveling students are encouraged to attend a gathering with the same course as their own; however, students who do not have that option may attend any Pathway gathering. (This does not apply to institute courses.) Students should direct any attendance-related questions to their online instructors for BYU-Idaho courses or their institute instructor for institute courses.</p>
					<p>To find a gathering location in a city you are traveling to, do the following:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Search for a <a target="_blank" href="http://pathway.lds.org/finder/world">Pathway location</a>, and contact the local Pathway missionaries.
							<ul>
								<li>Contact information for each Pathway location is listed on individual location pages.</li>
